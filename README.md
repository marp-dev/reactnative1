## check the project [here](http://marp-reactnative-sample1.surge.sh/) (web version)

This is a sample project for learning/testing:
- react native
- expo
along with:
- hooks
- native base
I also have used redux, lodash among other things.

At the time being
- I applied a custom navigation/menu with a custom router
- I am still using expo

_NOTE: please consider this legacy code_

## how to run this project

- clone the project
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

optionally...
- `json-server --host 0.0.0.0 --watch ./db.json`
- using the json-server host & port in the app (generally `http://127.0.0.1:3000`)
