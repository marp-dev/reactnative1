This is a sample project for learning/testing:
- react native
- expo
along with:
- hooks
- native base
I also have used redux, lodash among other things.

At the time being
- I applied a custom navigation/menu with a custom router
- I am still using expo

## how to run this project

- clone the project
- `npm install`

then eather run this (each on different terminals);
- `npm start` or `expo start`
- `json-server --host 0.0.0.0 --watch ./db.json`

or this (if you have installed tmux);
- `./start.sh`

This project needs `json-server` running. By now it is the 'database' used
